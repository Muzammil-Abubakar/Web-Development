First we will write 

<!DOCTYPE html>


then we will write 

<html lang="en">

then we will write head and then the main thing called body

<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name = "viewport">
<title> Document </title>
</head>

<body>
</body>

</html>

---
we put link in head of html to link css with html
and we put script in the body just before the end tag, we have to provide a src to script and it is written in between the starting brackets

meta description is what is shown on google below clickable link of website 

then there are also attributes that are defined with key value pairs

the most important part of being a developers is to copy paste things that are redundant and not necessary

then there is heading tag used to make headings, the good use of heading tags matters somewhat for SEO. It is used to build heirarchy.

Then we are also studying the paragraph tag 

alert tag waits for answer before showing the rest of the page.

Attributes are the stuff that are within a tag or element to further improve its functionality 

anchor tag <a> is used for making links, it has another attribute target for opening in a new blank page

img tags and then their attributes such as src alt and width height

table tag and then colspan and rowspan
