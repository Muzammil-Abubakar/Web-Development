This is for flexbox, first we include 3 divs inside a div with class name = container, the others have class names such as item item 1

then we go into the css propery of that and assign it display: flex;
then we can change the flex-direction, then we also have options for aligning items along main axis and cross axis
main axis is the axis that is horizontal by default, and we make changes in it by using justify content, then we have cross axis which uses align items
align content is something that only works when we have flex-wrap enabled

flex grow, flex shirnk and flex basis are used to grow an element based on remaining space, shrink an element respective to others, and provide a default width before the element starts shrinking respectively.

Then we also have the align self property that is used to align on cross axis just for the individual element selected
