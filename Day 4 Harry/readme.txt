Element Selector: changes the properties for all usages of that element

Class Selector: Changes the properties for all usages of that Class

Id Selector: Changes the properties for all usages of that id.

Child Selector: changes the direct child of the first element in form div > p, div is the parent

Descendant Selector: Changes the child even if it is not direct child.

Padding: Exists within the element outside the content
Border: Exists outside the padding but inside the margin.
