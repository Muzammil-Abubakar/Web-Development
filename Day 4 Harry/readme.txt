Element Selector: changes the properties for all usages of that element

Class Selector: Changes the properties for all usages of that Class

Id Selector: Changes the properties for all usages of that id.

Child Selector: changes the direct child of the first element in form div > p, div is the parent

Descendant Selector: Changes the child even if it is not direct child.

Universal Selector: Changes the properties for the overall html document

Attribute Selector: We just type it as a sentence in the attribute of an element like data=x and then we can change the element using this propery in our style sheet like this, [data=x], after that the whole styles we want to apply

Margin: Exists Outside the element
Padding: Exists within the element outside the content
Border: Exists outside the padding but inside the margin.

Border-Box: Total Height and width equals provided height and width
Content-Box: Total height and width equals content height and width
