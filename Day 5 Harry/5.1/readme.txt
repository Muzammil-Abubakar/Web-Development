Fonts and colors, whenever we use the font family tag we give a main font that the browser tries to apply and if that is not available it falls back to other fonts provided

We have font-style property, font-decoration property and font weight weight property, all of them are for something useful related to fonts such as bold italics or underline

We can get fonts from google fonts and we can either import it into the style sheet or use them as a link.

Inspect tool is really good if you want to see what a bulk of your changes would look like

Line Height is the spacing between lines, letter spacing s used to add spaced between letters in a word

then we have text-decoration, text-transform, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, text_decoration thickness, text indent

text overflow is an important feature that i should learn properly. text overflow will add the type and overflow will add the hidden property, if we set the property of text-overflow as clip than the text will clip and it would not be visible

Then there is also the word break property that breaks the word entirely if it does not fit the width.

Then we also have text align centre
